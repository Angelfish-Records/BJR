# Angelfish Records — Brendan John Roch

This repository contains the official website for **Brendan John Roch**, published and maintained by **Angelfish Records**. The site functions as the canonical home for releases, long-form work, and authenticated fan access, and is designed to evolve alongside the artist’s catalogue and audience.

The website is built as a modern, performance-focused web application with a strong emphasis on durability, accessibility, and long-term ownership of both content and audience relationships. It supports streaming media, gated material, and direct engagement without reliance on third-party platforms as the primary interface.

This codebase is actively maintained and reflects production infrastructure rather than a demo or starter project. It is not intended as a general template or learning resource.
